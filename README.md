# ivy's peppers
open source repository for our games "ivy's peppers"

# modding
this game is open source, so might as well do something with that!

feel free to fork this game and add your own peppers, gamemodes, etc!

i want this to be a project owned by everyone, and I think it would be fun as hell if everyone could put their own unique twist on this game

the primary directories you really need to be concerned about when making custom shit are `src/server/peppers` and `src/server/gamemodes`

id consider my code hot garbage... so hopefully you can deal with that hahahahahaha

have fun adding your own stuff ^-^

oh ya, if ur making ur fork, keep in mind we use a [attribution sharealike creative commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). the requirements shouldnt be too restricting, but if you have any problems feel free to contact me

and if you're using ANY artwork from the game for any purpose, please credit @pnmpki! they are a very talented artist and would like if they got credited (if u especially like the art, you cant give money to them directly, so we'll add a method here once it comes)
